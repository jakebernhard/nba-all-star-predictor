# 🏀 NBA All-Star Predictor

This project uses **machine learning** to predict which NBA players are most likely to become **All-Stars**, based on player statistics.

The dataset was sourced from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com), with additional columns added for **season year** and **All-Star status** (including players selected but replaced due to injury or load management).

📊 The analysis explores:
- Which player metrics most strongly influence All-Star selection  
- How model accuracy changes over different seasons 
- Feature importance and player comparatives between frontcourt and backcourt players
